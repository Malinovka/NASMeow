* *Random color changes*
* *Life-like feline movements*
* *No practical uses*

Writes directly from and to I/O ports (Serial I/O for output and and RTC for timing). No interrupts.
This will only run at kernel-level, so kexec or boot into it some other way if (for some reason) you wanted to see it in action.
